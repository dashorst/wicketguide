= Apache Wicket Reference Guide
A Living and Breathing Reference Guide for Apache Wicket
:article:

This project features an alternative to the current GDoc based Reference Guide
for Apache Wicket. As GDoc is declining in use (Groovy and Grails are migrating
to Asciidoctor.org) and Asciidoctor.org is becoming more mainstream it seems
like a good idea to evaluate what it brings to the table.

== Living Code

The major benefit of using Asciidoctor is that it can run in a Maven build and
that you can include snippets of code from your Java project. This makes sure
that the examples in the Reference Guide actually compile, and if we do it right
that they even work as advertised.

You can see this link:src/main/asciidoc/ajax/ajaxbehaviours.adoc[in action in the docs here].

== Caveats

The current Maven setup doesn't work properly with including tagged regions from
XML/HTML files, but the most recent (1.5.1) commandline Asciidoctor does work as
advertised.

To generate the docs use:

[source,bash]
----
./gendocs
----

which will start Asciidoctor using the same commandline the Maven plugin does
(without some incompatible commandline options). The generated documentation can
be found in `target/generated-resources/index.html`

When the *Asciidoctor Maven Plugin* **finally** ships with a working XML/HTML
tag based include directive we can remove this `gendocs` file and fully rely on
Maven as God intended.
